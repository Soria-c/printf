## General info
This project is the first group project of the course of Foundations at Holberton School Peru.
Our goal was to create a program that performs the same functions as "printf", which is a pre-defined function in C language and which is defined under ``‹stdio.h›`` library.

``_printf()``function may be used in any C language program. And this is the prototype:

```
_printf(const char *format, ...)
```

"format" is the string that could contain any number of specifiers folloewd by a '`%`' symbol.

## Technologies
* This Project is created with:
* C version: C90
* GCC version: gcc (Ubuntu 9.3.0-17ubuntu1~20.04) 9.3.0
